# goprofui ui
The UI for goprofui. Uses knockout, d3 and stealjs.

## To build
Run `npm install` and then `node build`. Will transpile and minify all less/es6 to files in the `dist` directory. 

## Debugging and Development
Serve this directory and navigate to `/dev.index.html`. This runs stealjs in dev mode, which builds on the fly and uses source maps for js and less.
